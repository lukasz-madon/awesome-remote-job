# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Check if the link is working and pointing to the right location.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Choose the corresponding section.
- The list, after your addition, should be sorted alphabetically.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization, are welcome.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Use the following format for the commit message: `Add Company Foo.io` (without 'awesome' or something else).
- Keep descriptions short, sweet and to the point.
- Use the following format: `[Name](link) - Description.` keep the len(description + name) < 100

Don't use any vague marketing language. Optimize word greppability. For example, if one wants to find python jobs, or to filter for US-only comapnies, the following descriptions would be useful:

1. [Foo](foo.io) - We are bulding new certificate provider based on crypocurrencies. Python, Scala, JS, Full Time
1. [Bar](bar.io) - Uber for friut baskests. Node, grunt, JS, workday overlaps New York afternoons (1700 - 2200 UTC)

- Feel free to post your own company.
- Companies should have "remote DNA"
- Link to the career/job page rather than to a single job post.
- Job boards should be high quality, without paywalls, requiring login, etc.
- No agencies please.

Thank you for your suggestions!
